# Contributing to CMS
We're currently in the process of developing `v1.0` but there are still issues to iron out with the existing distro: `v0.x.x`. So we've compiled this short document to help you guys help *us*! (we need help lol)

### What branch do I work from? How do I even pull request?
These are the branches in this project, and what they're for.
- `master`
  - This branch is for the current release of CMS, so 0.* releases. If you wish to submit a PR with a fix, please do it from this branch.
- `pre-1.0-develop`
  - This branch is for active development on the current relase, so 0.* etc. If you wish to PR with a feature that doesn't make a fix, please do so to this branch, but please make sure your branches are up to date.
- `develop`
  - This is for active development on the next major release of CMS, so 1.0+, feel free to take a look at this, though please don't rely on this for your projects as it's still a WIP.

We're planning on cleaning everything up once `1.0` is released, so if you're able to follow these guidelines, it will make things much easier for us.
